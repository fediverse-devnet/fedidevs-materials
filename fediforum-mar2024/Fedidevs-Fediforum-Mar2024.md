# Idea

	&nbsp;
	- A resource for developers building new services to integrate with the Fediverse
	&nbsp;
	- A space for developers to share ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn from each other

---
# Three core concepts

	> 1. Developers in the Fediverse should have an easy way to ***find each other*** and ***catch up on what's happening***.
	&nbsp;
	> 2. New developers need a ***resource library of best practices***, emerging concepts, and ***documentation*** to prepare for connecting their apps to a global federated network.
	&nbsp;
	> 3. There needs to be ***a place to publish guides and tools*** that make everyone's lives easier.
