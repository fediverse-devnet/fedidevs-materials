Welcome to our session for the Fediverse Developer Network! [https://fedidevs.org](https://fedidevs.org) #fedidevs

The community is for developers who are building new services to integrate with the Fediverse. We hope to create a space where developers can share ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn from each other. We aim to help accelerate the growth and adoption of the Fediverse by enabling developers to quickly “get to grips” with common standards, behaviours and expectations.

It is _not intended to replace_ other resources such as SocialHub, or the existing standards bodies involved in the space (e.g. W3C, IETF, and the less-formal FEP conversations and processes).

In this brainstorming session, my aim is to discuss the following topics:

* The goals of the Fediverse Developer Network
* The features that we would like to see on the website
* How to make the website _useful_
* Ways to promote the site and attract developers


## Goals

Nicely summarised [here](https://wedistribute.org/2024/03/extending-activitypub/#fedidevs).

Three big ideas:

1. Developers in the Fediverse ought to have an easy way to find where everyone else is at, and catch up on what’s happening.
2. New developers need a resource library of best practices, emerging concepts, and documentation to prepare for connecting their apps to a global federated network.
3. There needs to be a place to publish guides and tools that make everyone’s lives easier.

[relatedly: there’s FediTest, a test suite for integration, which is currently in very early stages, under the same GitHub org]


### Previously…

Last year I wrote a blog post and came up with a conceptual diagram that looks like this (needs updating!!)

## Current status

* A GitHub org and verified domain [https://github.com/fediverse-devnet](https://github.com/fediverse-devnet)
* Website / landing page [https://fedidevs.org](https://fedidevs.org)
    * Some, limited, project-specific documentation
* Discussion spaces:
    * A Matrix room [https://matrix.to/#/#fediverse-devs:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#fediverse-devs:matrix.org)
    * A Mastodon identity @[fedidevs@mastodon.social](mailto:fedidevs@mastodon.social) and hashtag #fedidevs
    * Friendica group [https://venera.social/profile/fedidevs](https://venera.social/profile/fedidevs)
    * Occasional show-and-tell meetings (currently, via Jitsi; TBD the schedule and whether to record and maintain)
        * Last one demo’ed early work on FediTest
        * [https://fedidevs.org/notes/2024-03-07/](https://fedidevs.org/notes/2024-03-07/) for minutes and recording


## Features / need to have

* More documentation
* Better navigation and discovery
* Index to libraries / SDKs?


## What should we do next?

* Meeting / show-and-tell schedule (was a top ask at the last meeting)
